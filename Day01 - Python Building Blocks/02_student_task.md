# **Day 1 — Student Assignment**

## **Instructions**

Welcome to your first assignment! This assignment will help you practice all the concepts you learned in Day 1's notes.

**How to approach this:**

1. Read each task carefully
2. Write your code in a Python file (e.g., `day1_tasks.py`)
3. Test your code by running it
4. Make sure your output matches the expected format
5. For the mini project, create a separate file (e.g., `user_info_collector.py`)

**Important Notes:**

- Use f-strings for all string formatting
- Add comments to explain your code
- Test your code with different inputs
- Don't worry if you make mistakes—debugging is part of learning!

## **Tasks**

### **Task 1: Variables and Data Types**

Create a Python script that:

1. Stores your personal information in variables:

   - Full name (string)
   - Age (integer)
   - Height in meters (float)
   - Favorite programming language (string)
   - Years of coding experience (integer)
   - Currently learning Python (boolean)

2. Display all this information using f-strings in a nicely formatted way

3. Use `type()` to show the data type of each variable

**Expected format:**

```
=== Personal Information ===
Name: [Your Name]
Age: [Your Age]
...
```

### **Task 2: f-strings Practice**

Create a script that:

1. Stores the following information about a product:

   - Product name: "Wireless Mouse"
   - Price: 29.99
   - Quantity: 5
   - Discount percentage: 10

2. Calculate:

   - Total before discount (price × quantity)
   - Discount amount (total × discount percentage / 100)
   - Final total after discount

3. Display a formatted receipt using f-strings that shows:
   - Product name
   - Unit price
   - Quantity
   - Subtotal
   - Discount percentage and amount
   - Final total

**Make it look professional with proper formatting!**

---

### **Task 3: User Input and Type Conversion**

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for their first name
2. Asks for their last name
3. Asks for their birth year (as a number)
4. Calculates their age (assume current year is 2024)
5. Asks for their favorite number
6. Displays a personalized message that includes:
   - Full name (first + last)
   - Age
   - Their favorite number multiplied by 2

**Handle the type conversions properly!**

---

### **Task 4: Truthy and Falsy Values**

Create a script that tests various values to determine if they're truthy or falsy:

1. Test these values:

   - `0`
   - `1`
   - `""` (empty string)
   - `"hello"`
   - `[]` (empty list)
   - `[1, 2, 3]`
   - `None`
   - `True`
   - `False`
   - `"False"` (the string, not the boolean)

2. For each value, print:
   - The value itself
   - Whether it's truthy or falsy
   - A brief explanation

**Format your output in a table-like structure using f-strings.**

---

### **Task 5: Arithmetic Operators**

Build a simple math calculator that:

1. Takes two numbers from the user
2. Performs and displays all arithmetic operations:

   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division (regular)
   - Floor division
   - Modulo (remainder)
   - Exponentiation

3. Format the output clearly, showing the operation and result

**Example format:**

```
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
...
```

---

### **Task 6: Comparison and Logical Operators**

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for their age
2. Asks if they have a driver's license (yes/no)
3. Uses comparison and logical operators to determine:

   - Can they drive? (age >= 18 AND has license)
   - Are they a senior? (age >= 65)
   - Are they a teenager? (age >= 13 AND age < 20)
   - Can they vote? (age >= 18)

4. Display the results in a clear format

**Use logical operators (and, or, not) appropriately!**

---

## **Expected Output Section**

Each task should produce clear, readable output that demonstrates:

- Correct use of variables and data types
- Proper f-string formatting
- Successful user input handling
- Accurate operator calculations
- Clear display of truthy/falsy values

Make sure your output is clean, readable, and properly formatted.
