# **Day 2 — Student Assignment**

## **Instructions**

This assignment will help you practice conditional logic, lists, dictionaries, and loops. Work through each task systematically, testing your code as you go.

**How to approach this:**
1. Read each task carefully
2. Write your code in a Python file (e.g., `day2_tasks.py`)
3. Test your code by running it
4. Make sure your output matches the expected format
5. For the mini project, create a separate file

**Important Notes:**
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments to explain your logic
- Test with different inputs
- Handle edge cases (empty lists, missing keys, etc.)

## **Tasks**

### **Task 1: Conditional Logic**

Write a program that:
1. Asks the user for their age
2. Determines their category:
   - Child: 0-12
   - Teen: 13-19
   - Adult: 20-64
   - Senior: 65+
3. Asks if they have a driver's license (yes/no)
4. Displays what they can do based on age and license status:
   - Can vote? (18+)
   - Can drive? (18+ and has license)
   - Can drink? (21+, US context)
   - Eligible for senior discount? (65+)

Use if-elif-else statements and display results clearly.

### **Task 2: List Operations**

Create a program that:
1. Starts with an empty list
2. Allows the user to add items (one at a time)
3. Shows the current list after each addition
4. When user types "done", the program should:
   - Display the final list
   - Show the number of items
   - Show the first and last items
   - Sort the list and display it
   - Ask if they want to remove any item
   - Display the final list

Use list methods like `append()`, `sort()`, `remove()`, etc.

### **Task 3: List Methods Practice**

Given this list: `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3, 7, 4, 6, 2]`

Write code that:
1. Finds the maximum and minimum values
2. Counts how many times 2 appears
3. Removes all occurrences of 2
4. Sorts the list in ascending order
5. Reverses the sorted list
6. Inserts the number 10 at position 3
7. Creates a copy of the list and clears the original
8. Displays all results

---

### **Task 4: Dictionary Basics**

Create a dictionary to store information about a book with these keys:
- title
- author
- year
- pages
- rating (out of 5)

1. Create the dictionary with sample data
2. Display all information using a loop
3. Update the rating
4. Add a new key "genre"
5. Check if "publisher" key exists, if not add it
6. Remove the "year" key
7. Display the final dictionary

---

### **Task 5: for Loop Practice**

Write a program that:
1. Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 20
2. Uses a for loop to:
   - Print all even numbers
   - Print all numbers divisible by 3
   - Calculate the sum of all numbers
   - Calculate the product of all numbers
3. Uses `enumerate()` to print each number with its index
4. Uses `range()` to print numbers from 10 to 1 (backwards)

---

### **Task 6: Combining Concepts**

Create a program that:
1. Asks the user to enter 5 numbers
2. Stores them in a list
3. Uses a for loop to:
   - Find the maximum number
   - Find the minimum number
   - Calculate the average
4. Uses conditional logic to categorize each number:
   - "High" if >= 80
   - "Medium" if >= 50
   - "Low" if < 50
5. Stores the results in a dictionary with keys: max, min, average, categories
6. Displays the dictionary in a formatted way

---

## **Expected Output Section**

Each task should produce clear, readable output that demonstrates:
- Correct use of if-elif-else statements
- Proper list creation and manipulation
- Effective use of list methods
- Dictionary creation and operations
- Proper for loop implementation
- Clean formatting and organization

Make sure your output is well-formatted and easy to read.
