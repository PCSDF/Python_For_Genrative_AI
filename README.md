> **A fast, structured, and high-impact learning path designed to take you from zero to AI-ready in Python. This curriculum focuses specifically on the Python skills needed for Generative AI, RAG, and LLM development.**

## 🎯 Curriculum Philosophy

Most Python courses teach you everything (web scraping, games, GUI). **We don't.**
This roadmap is surgically precise. It teaches only the Python concepts strictly required to build AI agents, process data for LLMs, and handle API requests.

**By Day 6, you will be able to:**
* Write clean, modular functions for AI pipelines.
* Handle JSON data from OpenAI/Anthropic APIs.
* Manage environments and API keys securely.
* Build a foundational project ready for the RAG course.

## 📚 Roadmap Overview

| Day | Module Title | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Python Building Blocks** | Variables, Data Types, and Logic Flow |
| **02** | **Data Structures for AI** | Lists, Dicts, and JSON manipulation |
| **03** | **Functions & Modularity** | Writing reusable code and error handling |
| **04** | **File Handling & I/O** | Reading/Writing Logs, PDFs, and Text files |
| **05** | **APIs & Libraries** | `requests`, `os`, and Environment Variables |
| **06** | **Final Capstone** | Building your first AI-ready Python tool |

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### The 3-Step Daily Routine
Each day folder contains three critical files. Follow this exact sequence:

1.  **`01_notes.md`** (The Theory)
    * Start here. Read the core concepts and study the code snippets.
2.  **`02_student_task.md`** (The Practice)
    * Apply what you learned. Solve these small coding challenges.
3.  **`03_mini_project.md`** (The Build)
    * Combine everything into a working script. This is your portfolio piece.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Python 3.7+** (Python 3.10 recommended for modern type hinting).
* **VS Code** (or any code editor).

### 2. Quick Setup
Clone the repository and verify your installation:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/pcsdf/Python-for-GenAI.git](https://github.com/pcsdf/Python-for-GenAI.git)

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.7 or higher

### Required Libraries

Most libraries are built-in, but you'll need to install:

```bash
pip install requests
```

The following are built-in (no installation needed):

- `json` - For JSON file operations
- `csv` - For CSV file operations
- `math`, `random`, `datetime` - Standard library modules

### How to Run Programs

1. **Create a Python file**: `filename.py`
2. **Run from terminal**:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 filename.py
   ```
3. **Run examples directly**: Copy code from notes into a file and execute

## Learning Tips

1. **Don't rush** - Take your time with each concept
2. **Code along** - Type out examples instead of just reading
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples to see what happens
4. **Practice daily** - Consistency beats intensity
5. **Ask questions** - If something doesn't make sense, review the notes
6. **Complete projects** - The mini projects are crucial for understanding

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Ability to install software
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor)
- Internet connection (for Day 4 API examples)

No prior programming experience required!
